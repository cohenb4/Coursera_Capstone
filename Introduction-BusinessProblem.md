# Introduction/Business Problem
## Introduction
Over the past three years I have studied at the University of Cincinnati. In may I will graduate with a bachelor's degree in Information Systems. I am currently looking at graduate schools. The University of Cincinnati serves the people of Ohio, the nation, and the world as a premier, public, urban research university dedicated to undergraduate, graduate, and professional education, experience-based learning, and research. The University of Maryland, College Park is the state's flagship university and one of the nation's preeminent public research universities. A global leader in research, entrepreneurship and innovation, the university is home to more than 41,000 students, 14,000 faculty and staff, and 388,000 alumni all dedicated to the pursuit of Fearless Ideas.

## Problem
As I approach the end of my undergraduate experience, I need to choose which college is best for me. These factors include: acceptance rate, highest paying jobs, majors awarded, other student expenses (room and board), average time of completion, tuition costs, and venues around campus.
