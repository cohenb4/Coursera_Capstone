# Data Section
## Data Usage
### Location/Venues
* I will leverage the Fousquare API in order to determine coffee shops in the area. I will also use a list of neighborhoods in the area through https://cocl.us/new_york_dataset
### Types of Coffee
* I will use https://github.com/Venkat-ds/ICO/blob/master/ICO_CROP_DATA.csv for data on what type of coffee to sell based on consumption
### Coffee Demographics
* I will use Statista for coffee statistics on demographic profiles
