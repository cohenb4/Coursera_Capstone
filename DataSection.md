Based on our problem, certain factors that we will look for include:
- Acceptance Rate
- Highest Paying Jobs by Major
- Majors Awarded
- Other Student Expenses
- Time to Complete
- Tuition Costs
- Venues Around Campus

We decided to use regularuly spaced grids, around the center of the cities to define neighborhoods and boroughs.

The data sources used to extract and generate the required information are:
- University of Cincinnati data is scraped from: https://datausa.io/profile/university/university-of-cincinnati-main-campus
- University of Maryland data is scraped from: https://datausa.io/profile/university/university-of-maryland-college-park
- Foursquare' API is used to find all of the venues in the area
